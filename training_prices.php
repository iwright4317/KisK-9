		<h3>Good dog training should be affordable</h3>
		<p>
I have a German shepherd dog that is a rescue and lived in 3 different homes times before coming to live with me. He has been a life-changer for me and led me to professionally train dogs, after learning dog training is my calling in life. 
Unfortunately, untrained dogs are the norm, and trained dogs really stood out. I wanted to make one-on-one dog training more affordable for people. I also offer Pick-up and Train for the super-busy. Sadly, sometimes dogs are removed from the home because of bad behavior. This can be avoided through training. I don't want the cost of training to stop dogs from getting the training they should have. Good training benefits the whole family, the dog, and the people and animals around us. I invite you to take a look at my testimonials page to read what my customers have to say about my training. My success encourages me to work harder to improve dog behavior.
