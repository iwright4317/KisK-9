   				<h3>Kiley has truly been a blessing</h3>
   				<p>
				   Kiley has truly been a blessing to my household. We have two dogs who were in desperate need 
				   of training because they were so leash reactive. It was impossible for me to be able to walk 
				   both of them at the same time.

We saw an immediate difference in both dogs by the end of the first session! Asher and King were able to 
make a dog-friend with Kiley's guidance by the fourth session! This was something I thought I would never see.
She has been able to help us with resource guarding, leash reactivity, dog reactivity, barking, crate 
training, calm training, and nail trimming!! Our dogs were anxious messes before she came along. We didn't 
just want to seek help from a trainer to make our lives easier, but we wanted to make our dogs HAPPIER. 
I wanted my dogs to have the highest quality of life that they could, and they are definitely getting 
close to that all because of her! !

   				<h3>Kiley is a skilled, knowledgeable, compassionate trainer</h3>
   				<p>
   					Kiley is an amazing trainer. I recently got a puppy and my boyfriend‚Äôs dog was 
   					having a lot of issues with resource guarding and dominance. He was snarling
   					 and attacking the puppy. We brought her in to help curb those behaviors. 
   					 Her consultation was thorough and she came up with a personalized program 
   					 for our dogs. The difference in the dogs was palpable after only a few 
   					 training sessions. Their behavior (particularly the older one‚Äôs) was so 
   					 much improved. They went from not interacting at all to playing with one 
   					 another; and not sharing toys to playing tug of war. After a few sessions 
   					 I finally felt comfortable letting the dogs be alone with one another 
   					 for short amounts of time which was something I wasn‚Äôt sure was possible. 
   					 I went into training without any expectations, and this has far exceeded 
   					 anything I could have hoped for. Kiley is a skilled, knowledgeable, 
   					 compassionate trainer. She is the only person I would trust with training 
   					 my dog! If you‚Äôre in need of a dog trainer, enlist her help. You won‚Äôt be 
   					 disappointed!

   					Kiley with K-9 Training has been amazing with training our Nipsey. He‚Äôs the 
   					first puppy we‚Äôve had and Kiley was readily available to help us within the 
   					first week of him coming home! She has a way with dogs AND people to help put 
   					u at ease. I love that Kiley gets to know us and adjusts each session to our 
   					family needs. You can tell she genuinely cares for her clients and has a lot 
   					of experience. I have two daughters and Kiley takes the time to get to know 
   					them as well. She really becomes part of the family and addresses our own 
   					doggie needs!!!

   					I‚Äôm sooooooo happy a friend referred us to Ki‚Äôs K-9 Training. I was 
   					really concerned about training and socialization for my little fur 
   					baby, Maci Grey, especially during the pandemic. Kiley is absolutely 
   					amazing with her, and is really working to build her confidence and her 
   					feisty little personality! She‚Äôs patient, and works really hard to 
   					build Maci‚Äôs trust, while also teaching both of us skills to last a 
   					lifetime! Equally as important, Kiley maintains compliance with all 
   					CDC guidelines for the virus, including mask wearing, hand washing and 
   					social distancing. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better partner in 
   					training for Maci!! Thanks soooo much, Kiley!! You‚Äôre the best!!

   					Kiley is an amazing trainer and my pit baby Kilo just ADORES and LOVES her. 
   					He always lights up when he sees her lol. She is very informative and 
   					consistent. The homework she gives us helps out so much. Kilo‚Äôs behavior 
   					changed within the first week of training, it was huge progress. He had 
   					some issues with jumping on people and pulling while walking, now people 
   					can come into the house without him jumping and walks are a breeze! I 
   					can‚Äôt wait until we start training on his resource guarding I know she‚Äôs 
   					going to help out a big deal with that. I would HIGHLY recommend her to 
   					anyone with a fur baby üôÇ. She is awesome!

   				<h3>Kiley was an outstanding trainer with my dog!!</h3>
   				<p>Kiley was an outstanding trainer with my dog!!  We had a German Shepard Dog named Sable that had many issues, including separation anxiety, as well as aggression.  Kiley met with Sable for a consultation to assess Sable‚Äôs issues.  We were amazed at how Kiley bonded with Sable and got to work right away.  She would take Sable around other dogs slowly until she was more comfortable and less aggressive, until Sable could finally be amongst a group of dogs and get along and play together without aggression.  It was great to see such a positive transition from the training.  Kiley was also able to break Sable of her separation anxiety with careful and positive training, which led to an end of destructive behavior.  Now Sable is such a wonderful and obedient family member.  We would highly recommend Kiley as a trainer for your fur babies!
